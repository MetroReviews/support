## List Etiquette
We realize and understand that no Bot List is the same. With that in mind there are still a few Guidelines that Bot Lists and their Staff Team should follow

### Best Practice
All Servers should follow the Discord [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

---

### Server Rules
All Bot Lists should have a clear and obvious point of entry to their Server Rules these rules should tell their users what is and is not allowed in their Server.
